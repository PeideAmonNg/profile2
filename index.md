### Work Experience

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PeideAmonNg/profile2/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Education

Constantly learning new ways of thinking and software craftsmanship through reading, exploring, and applying. My formal education background is as follows:

- AWS Associate Developer

I have learned a lot through online forums such as Medium, StackOverflow, and software companies' blog posts, and personal blogs by great minds in the engineering field. I also learned and shared a great deal of knowledge through discussions with colleagues.
